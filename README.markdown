hyperloglog
===========

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hyperloglog.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hyperloglog) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/hyperloglog/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/hyperloglog/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

This package provides a working implementation of HyperLogLog.

**This library should not be used for cryptographic or security applications**,
as this implementation of HyperLogLog does not generate keys from a
cryptographically secure source of randomness.
